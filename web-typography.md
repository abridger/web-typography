Web Typography
==============

Type Basics
-----------
* font face vs font family
* serif, sans-serif and monospace
* font classifations
* font weight
* x-height

###Font Size
`font-size`
* In print, this is described in points or picas, but on the web it is described in pixels or ems.
* This can be set with pixel height, but it's recommended to use em rather than pixels to allow users to resize the text in the browser menu. Em units are recommended by W3C. 1em is equal to the current font size. The default text size in browsers is 16px. So, the default size of 1em is 16px.
* Unfortunately, there is still a problem with older versions of IE and ems. The text becomes larger than it should when made larger, and smaller than it should when made smaller. The solution that works in all browsers, is to set a default font-size in percent for the <body> element and then use ems to set the size of specific elements in the body:

`body {font-size: 100%;}
h1 {font-size: 2.5em;}`

###X-Height

###Measure & Responsive Typography
* The length of a line of text.
* For a singe column layout, the measure should be between 45 and 75 characters, with the optimimum generally considered to be 65 characters per line.

[Smashing Magazine] [2]

###Font Style
`font-style: normal`
`font-style: italic`

###Leading
`line-height`
* The space between lines of text is referred to as leading in print typography, and refers to the distance between the baselines of successive lines of type. Strips of lead used to be used to separate the lines of type from another and increase the line height.
* Leading or line-height can be used to increase readability of type. Greater space between lines of type means that the eye can more easily pick out type with a smaller x-height, and follow long-form type better.
* Set using line-height in CSS: `line-height: 1.2em;` or `line-height: 120%`;

###Decorative, Heading and Body Fonts


###Glyphs

###Typographic Hierarchy

###Readability

###A Couple of Pedantic Points...

####Typographer's Quotes
* Ideally, text should use typographer's quotes (curly quote marks)

####Hyphens, N-Dashes and M-Dashes


A Brief History of Typography
-----------------------------


History of Web Typography
-------------------------

###Font Availability



###Screen Limitations
Popular web fonts (Arial, Verdana, Georgia, and Times New Roman) are such not only because of their wide availability, but because they are drawn with the screenâ€™s limitations in mind. For example, Georgia reads better on screen than Garamond primarily because it has a higher x-height, and therefore a larger eye.

Computers only used to have 256 colours avaiable, and low resolution screens (the web is generally optimised for 72dpi). With almost all monitors now displaying 16million colours and rendering type edges much more smoothly, a greater range of fonts render better. Tablets and phones now also display at much closer to print quality.
